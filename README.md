# Personal_AI_Projects
I am doing project-based learning to gain experience in building AI Agents and using/making MCP tools. I am targeting locally hosting these projects to avoid API usage fees. Also, I am using OpenAI's Agent SDK and CrewAI as the framework for the agents and using GPT-OSS 20B as the main model.
