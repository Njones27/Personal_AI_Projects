# Personal_AI_Projects
I am doing project-based learning to gain experience in building AI Agents and using/making MCP tools. I am targeting locally hosting these projects to avoid API usage fees. Also, I am using OpenAI's Agents SDK and CrewAI as the framework for the agents and using GPT-OSS 20B as the main model.

Documentation that has been useful in my development is below. 
[OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/quickstart/)
